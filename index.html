        <p class="sweeter">We've been dating a very long time, and you keep coming back for me every day, but you only have Kingfish sashimi like twice a week, so I would that you probably like me more. You're always pushing me to be a better person, and I hope I can make you as happy as you make me.</p>

You don't look too bad yourself. I could see me kissing that face every single day for eternity. You are literally the light of my life.</p>
